I've been training for more years than I care to admit (over 20). I love helping others to advance their owns skills and use of technology, whilst challenging myself to advance my own skills and expertise. Now focused on Microsoft 365, I train from beginner to admin and everyone in between, with a bit of Project, Visio and some SharePoint site building mixed in to keep things fresh.
