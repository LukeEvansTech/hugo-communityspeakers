## Sponorship opportunity

A fantastic line up of established community speakers.

The Microsoft New Speakers Community Day is being run as a not-for-profit event. We are charging a nominal fee to encourage low drop-out rates and cover some of the associated costs, however we're looking for sponsors to help cover remaining costs for the event, and to ensure we can deliver a great experience for attendees. 
Our goal is to help support new speakers as they embark on their tech speaking journey. Alongside this, we’re also focused on increasing diversity within the pool of speakers that we have within the UK Microsoft tech community, and provide support for those from disadvantaged backgrounds who wouldn’t otherwise consider getting involved. 
Speaking at tech events is incredibly rewarding, and public speaking skills are also increasingly important within the workplace, and for career development.
Attendees at our workshop will leave with skills that can help them get noticed, get promoted and unlock career potential.
Need to add a link to the sponsor pack file saved as pdf once everyone has reviewed it, and then add a link to the sponsor form once it has been created.
